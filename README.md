# BANNJOS
The Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks for the Javalambre Observatory Surveys pipeline, or BANNJOS, is a machine learning pipeline that derives any desired property of an astronomical object by means of supervised learning techniques. The pipeline is designed to be run at a wide variety of user input levels. It is capable of running nearly automatically once given the minimum input files or allows extensive customization through optional keywords for greater control over the process by the user.
